    "# Pairs Trading strategy with the application of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook imlpements a pairs trading stategy with by using PCA, OPTICS clustering and 4 pairs selection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for 200-300 stocks are collected. The data is transformed to the return series and thereafter normalized. PCA is then applied to the return series and the number of principle components will not exceed 15. OPTICS clustering is applied to the principle components and the stocks are consequently divided into classes. Each class will hold its own combination of possible pairs which will be determined with the 4 pairs selection criteria: Engel-granger, the Hurst expoennt, teh half-life of the spread and the number of times the spread crosses the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by loading the S&P500 stocks data for a specified start and end period together with the number of stocks needed as can be seen by the example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "define_stocks(\"2019-01-01\",\"2019-12-31\",250)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "It should be noted that only the adjusted closing price is included for each stock\n",
    "\n",
    "### The return series\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{i,t}$ is the price series of asset $i$. The price series will be transformed to the return series in order to apply PCA analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return series: $$ R_{i,t} = \\frac{P_{i,t - P_{i,t-1}}}{P_{i,t-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalized return series: $$ Y_{i} = \\frac{R_{i} - \\bar{R_{i}}}{\\sigma_{i}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dimentionality reduction: Principle Component Analysis(PCA)\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA is applied to the return series where the stocks are observations and the variables are the time series of each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~pthon\n",
    "pca = PCA(n_components = 3)\n",
    "principalComponents = pca.fit_transform(transposed_data)\n",
    "principalDf = pd.DataFrame(data = principalComponents\n",
    "              ,columns = ['pc1', 'pc2','pc3'])\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "## OPTICS unsupervised clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply OPTICS clustering to the principle components\n",
    "![plotly.png](attachment:plotly.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pairs selection criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 4 criteria need to be met for the stock pair to be a successful match.\n",
    "A cluster can be selected and each criteria for the pair combinations will be displayed.\n",
    "For example cluster 6 can be chosen as seen below:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "cluster_pairs(6)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engel-granger\n",
    "\n",
    "The Engel-granger test for cointegration has a Null Hypothesis of no cointegration and an Alternative Hypothesis of cointegration.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~python\n",
    "engel_granger_test = engle_granger(data[cluster_data_indexes[i]],data[cluster_data_indexes[j]])\n",
    "pval = engel_granger_test.pvalue\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "A p-value lower than 0.01 will reject the Null Hypothesis with a 1% level of significance. This pair will thus be cointegrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hurst exponent\n",
    "\n",
    "This exponent represents the relative tendency of a time series to regress strongly to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hedge ratio is the slope of linear regression between stock a and stock b.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread: $$ \\log(stock_a) - hedge_{ratio}*\\log(stock_b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The spread is used to calculate the hurst exponent. A hurst exponent < 0.5 yields a mean-reverting series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half-life of the spread\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean revertion should persist within the time period that the investor want to trade. The half-life of the spread should be between 1 day and 1 year. The half-life is measured in days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The number of times the mean of the spread was crossed each month during the months measured\n",
    "\n",
    "The spread between two stocks should cross the its mean at least once a month. This was measured in the number of months that the spread did cross its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook displayed a stategy to easily visualize stock pairs in a high dimentional time series. This analysis has shown that an investor may find promising pairs without exposing himself to the adversities of the common pairs searching techniques. \n"
